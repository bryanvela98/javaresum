    // An enum class is a special type of class that represents a group of constants
    // (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
    // Enums are used when we have a fixed set of related constants.
    // For example, days of the week, months of the year, directions (NORTH, SOUTH,
    // EAST, WEST), etc.
